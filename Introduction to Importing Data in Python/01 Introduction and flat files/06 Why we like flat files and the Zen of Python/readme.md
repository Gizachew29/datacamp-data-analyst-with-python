## Why we like flat files and the Zen of Python

In PythonLand, there are currently hundreds of *Python Enhancement Proposals*, commonly referred to as *PEPs*. [**PEP8**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), for example, is a standard style guide for Python, written by our sensei Guido van Rossum himself. It is the basis for how we here at DataCamp ask our [instructors to style their code](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation#tab_style_guide_python). Another one of my favorites is [**PEP20**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), commonly called the *Zen of Python*. Its abstract is as follows:

> ### *Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.*

If you don't know what the acronym `BDFL` stands for, I suggest that you look [here](https://docs.python.org/3.3/glossary.html#term-bdfl). You can print the Zen of Python in your shell by typing import this into it! You're going to do this now and the 5th aphorism (line) will say something of particular interest.
