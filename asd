01 Preparing the data for analysis
Before beginning your analysis, it is critical that you first examine and clean the dataset, to make working with it a more efficient process. In this chapter, you will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.

01 Examining the dataset
02 Dropping columns
03 Dropping rows
04 Finding an incorrect data type
05 Fixing a data type
06 Combining object columns
07 Setting the index

02 Exploring the relationship between gender and policing
Does the gender of a driver have an impact on police behavior during a traffic stop? In this chapter, you will explore that question while practicing filtering, grouping, method chaining, Boolean math, string methods, and more!

01 Examining traffic violations
02 Comparing violations by gender
03 Filtering by multiple conditions
04 Comparing speeding outcomes by gender
05 Calculating the search rate
06 Comparing search rates by gender
07 Adding a second factor to the analysis
08 Counting protective frisks
09 Comparing frisk rates by gender

03 Visual exploratory data analysis
Are you more likely to get arrested at a certain time of day? Are drug-related stops on the rise? In this chapter, you will answer these and other questions by analyzing the dataset visually, since plots can help you to understand trends in a way that examining the raw data cannot.

01 Calculating the hourly arrest rate
02 Plotting the hourly arrest rate
03 Plotting drug-related stops
04 Comparing drug and search rates
05 Tallying violations by district
06 Plotting violations by district
07 Converting stop durations to numbers
08 Plotting stop length

04 Analyzing the effect of weather on policing
In this chapter, you will use a second dataset to explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops. You will practice merging and reshaping datasets, assessing whether a data source is trustworthy, working with categorical data, and other advanced skills.

01 Plotting the temperature
02 Plotting the temperature difference
03 Counting bad weather conditions
04 Rating the weather conditions
05 Changing the data type to category
06 Preparing the DataFrames
07 Merging the DataFrames
08 Comparing arrest rates by weather rating
09 Selecting from a multi-indexed Series
10 Reshaping the arrest rate data
