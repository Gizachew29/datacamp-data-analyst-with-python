## Members only
Throughout the course so far, you've been exposed to some common problems that you may encounter with your data, from data type constraints, data range constrains, uniqueness constraints, and now membership constraints for categorical values.

In this exercise, you will map hypothetical problems to their respective categories.

**Instructions**
* Map the data problem observed with the correct type of data problem.

**Answer**
> **Membership Constraint**
> * A `GPA` column containing a `Z-` grade.
> * A `month` column with the value `14`.
> * A `day_of_week` column with the value `Suntermonday`.
